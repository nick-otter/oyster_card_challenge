# Oyster Card
Midweek task, assigned by Kay Lovelace, [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/nick-otter/boris_bikes_challenge), giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.
